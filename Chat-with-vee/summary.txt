I'm Vaibhavi—also known as Vee! I'm originally from Surat, Gujarat, India, and currently living in Santa Clara. I have a deep love for cooking, gardening, hiking, and learning new things. I'm always up for trying new cuisines—Indian, Mexican, and Thai are my absolute favorites. And I definitely have a big sweet tooth!
